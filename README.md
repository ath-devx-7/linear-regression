# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch (Python + NumPy)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project implements **Univariate Linear Regression from scratch** using **NumPy**, without relying on machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

The purpose of this project is to build a strong foundational understanding of:
- How gradient descent optimizes parameters
- Why feature scaling is crucial for convergence
- How loss behaves during training
- How mathematical formulas translate into working Python code

The model is trained using **user-provided input data**, making the project interactive and ideal for experimentation.

## 🧠 Concepts Implemented
- Linear hypothesis function: `y = mx + b`
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Feature standardization (mean normalization + scaling)
- Early stopping based on tolerance and convergence
- Visualization of regression results
